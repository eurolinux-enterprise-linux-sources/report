To build this package you will need the GNU autotools and GNU make
  installed.

To locally build a set of RPMs, type (in this directory):

    make rpm

  This will build a bunch of RPMs in a subdirectory of "RPMS".

To use mock to build the RPMs, type:

    make mock-fedora-12-i386

  or

     make mock-fedora-12-x86_64

  This will mock build a set of RPMs in a subdirectory of "MOCK".

Several different versions of Fedora and different architectures are
  provided.  (If the one you need isn't, edit "makefile.am", copy an
  existing "mock-xxx" rule, change what needs changing...)

The make-files provided by this package will automatically run
  autoreconf, and ./configure, if they have not already been run.
  You can run them by hand, but you don't have to.

It is also possible to build and install directly without going
  through RPM.  Type:

    make dist
    make all
    make install

  will make and install this package.  


At the moment, doing a 

    make 

  or

    make all

  will fail with an unreasonably cryptic error message when run on a
  fresh checkout from the Git repo, or a freshly cleaned directory
  tree.  The hack that causes bug this will be going away soon, and so
  I have not fixed it.  The work around for this, for now, is to do

    make dist

  before you do the

    make all

  which is why I have the seemingly extranious "make dist" above.
