.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBreport\fR [options] \fBfile\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
\fBreport\fR will deliver \fBfile\fR to a \fBtarget\fR.  A
\fBtarget\fR can be specified on the command line, in the [main]
section of the \fBreport\fR configuration files, or it will be
queried.  Each \fBtarget\fR is associated with a plugin which actually
delivers the \fBfile\fR.  Additional parameters needed by the plugin
are plugin specific, and may be specified on the command line, in
\fBtarget\fR specific configuration sections, or they will be queried.

.LP
The \fBfile\fR can be a specifically formatted problem 
report or an arbitrary file.  A 'target' can be ticket/case/bug tracking
systems, in which case \fBreport\fR can create new tickets or attach to
existing ones; or a 'target' can be a simple directory on local or 
remote file systems.   

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB--target\fR"
Specify the target.  This must be one of the targets configured in 
/etc/report.d/*.conf.
.IP "\fB--ticket\fR"
Specify a ticket or case or bug to the plugin specified by the target.  This
option is only valid for plugins that deal in cases, tickets or 
bugs; it is ignored by other plugins.  If the target config file also
defines a 'ticket' configuration, the command line overrides this.
.IP "\fB--host\fR"
Specify a host or case or bug to the plugin specified by the target.  This
option is only valid for plugins that deal in hosts; it is ignored by other
plugins.  If the target config file also defines a 'host' configuration, 
the command line overrides this.
.IP "\fB--path\fR"
Specify a path or case or bug to the plugin specified by the target.  This
option is only valid for plugins that deal in paths; it is ignored by other
plugins.  If the target config file also defines a 'path' configuration, 
the command line overrides this.
.IP "\fB--gtk\fR"
Use GTK dialog boxes for I/O from the Report library.
.IP "\fB-h\fR"
.IP "\fB--help\fR"
Command line help.
